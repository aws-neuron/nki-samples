# Neuron Kernel Interface (NKI) Samples

[AWS Neuron](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/) is the software development kit (SDK) designed for ML chips AWS Trainium and Inferentia: 
purpose built for AI workloads. 
At the core of the Neuron SDK is the Neuron Compiler, which takes computation graphs from frameworks like PyTorch and JAX and converts 
them into highly optimized machine code. 

[NKI](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/nki) is a Python-based programming environment designed for the compiler which
adopts commonly used NumPy and Triton-like syntax along with tile-level semantics. 
NKI also interoperates with the Neuron Profiler, providing insights into performance bottlenecks and instruction latencies. 
It offers tensor printing support, standard error messaging, and built-in kernel simulation capabilities for efficient debugging purposes. 
NKI offers two types of programming interfaces: 
NKI Language ([nki.language](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/nki/api/nki.language.html)) and 
NKI Instruction Set Architecture ([nki.isa](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/nki/api/nki.isa.html)), 
enabling bare-metal access to the chip for full control.

## Documentation
The latest NKI documentation can be found on the AWS Documentation site, [here](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/nki/). 
Documentation for NKI kernels are both inline (docstring) and available on the documentation site's 
[kernel API reference page](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/nki/api/nki.kernels.html).

## Repository Structure

### src

#### reference
This folder contains the source code of the `neuronxcc.nki.kernels`, and they are optimized kernels from the Neuron Team serving as samples. 

All kernels located in this folder have numeric accuracy tests 
and performance benchmarks defined in the [test](test/) directory. We also demonstrate using these kernels end-to-end in our [integration tests](test/integration/).

Note that these kernels are already being deployed as part of the Neuron stack. With flash attention as an example,
[compiling Llama models with transformers-neuronx](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/libraries/transformers-neuronx/transformers-neuronx-developer-guide.html)
will automatically invoke the `flash_fwd` kernel in [attention.py](src/reference/attention.py). Therefore, replacing the framework operators with these NKI kernels likely won't result in extra performance benefit.


#### tutorials
The [tutorial kernels](src/tutorials/) are for educational purpose and include the kernels that are used in NKI guides. 
You can clone these sample kernels and run them directly while reading through the 
[NKI documentation](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/nki/tutorials.html). These kernels are not necessarily high-performance, 
but contain detailed inline comments and have accompanying documentation. 

### test

#### unit
The [unit tests](test/unit) directory contains unit tests and micro-benchmarks for standalone kernels. They run across multiple possible configurations, 
verify the numeric accuracy of the operation, and publish performance results to the [micro-benchmark](docs/benchmarks/micro-benchmark/) results.

#### integration
The [integration tests](tests/integration) folder contains integration tests of (selected) kernels. They verify the numeric accuracy of the modelâ€™s output, 
and publish end-to-end performance results into the [integration benchmarks](docs/benchmarks/integration) folder.

## Maintenance Policy
NKI is currently released as **beta** while we gather feedback from our users and integrate it into the API. NKI API follow the [Neuron SDK Maintenance Policy](https://awsdocs-neuron.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/general/sdk-policy.html).
